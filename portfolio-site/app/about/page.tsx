            I started working with websites with HTML clear back in 2002 when it was revised and republished. 
            I have done everything from coding to graphic design to website SEO over the years. 
            But I have always had a passion for creating things that help others. Now I am here to offer my skills to help your business succeed. 
            One of my main components is a love for research. I really enjoy seeking out and learning information. 
            Between my own work and my University work I have thousands of hours of research time.

            I specialize in leveraging technology to solve complex problems and created automated solutions. 
            Iâ€™ve tackled challenges from advanced data integration, to comprehensive analytics, to web design and development, 
            and to process optimization. I excel at communicating with stakeholders and asking the right questions to form concise and meaningful business requirements. 
            I am highly capable of using those requirements to form a project scope and plan, and then execute that project. 
            Finally delivering a solution that meets the business needs and efficiently yet beautifully displays the needed information to the stakeholder or user.
